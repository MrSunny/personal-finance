This is an outline and checklist of our personal finance plan. I wanted to share
this as a starting point for others to form their own plan, and also to get
feedback on what we can improve. If you have a suggestion, feel free to [file an
issue](https://github.com/jch/personal-finance/issues) or email me at
jollyjerry@gmail.com.

## Debt

* Pay off loans
* Never keep a balance on credit cards, autopay everything in full
* Ask for a credit increase every 6 months
* Refinance for a lower interest rate on mortgages or large loans

## Short term savings

* Enough cash for emergencies and upcoming large purchases. e.g. cars, weddings,
  kids, college, accidents, vacations

## Long term savings

* 401k. At least as much as any employer matching, more if possible.
  Traditional 401k is pretax, Roth 401k's sometimes available.
* Individual Retirement Account (IRA)
* Charitable giving. Contributions to eligible organizations can be itemized as
  a deduction

## Extras

* Health Savings Account (HSA)
* 529 plan - saving for education expenses

## Tools

* Monthly review of spending with [Mint](https://www.mint.com). Categorize
  spending, note any large differences in monthly trends.
