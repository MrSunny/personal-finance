This is an outline of our personal finance plan. I'm sharing this as a starting
point for others to form their own plan, and also to gather feedback on what we
can improve. If you have a suggestion, feel free to [file an
issue](https://github.com/jch/personal-finance/issues) or email me at
jollyjerry@gmail.com.

## Debt

* Pay off loans
* Never keep a balance on credit cards, auto-pay everything in full
* Ask for a credit increase every 6 months, don't over do it
* Carry less than 1/3 of credit limit in credit card balance
* [Check credit score](https://www.annualcreditreport.com) once a year
* Refinance for a lower interest rate on mortgages or large loans

## Liquidity

* 12 months of expenses
* Budget out large purchases into monthly amounts to save. e.g. car, wedding, vacation

## Medical

* Health Savings Account (HSA). Maximize employer contributions.
  * Do not invest until balance would exceed minimum to avoid fees
  * preferably a plan that allows investment in index funds like Wells Fargo or Health Savings Administrators
  * Continue to pay medical expenses out of pocket when possible to maximize tax deferred growth

## Retirement

* Calculate whether Traditional or Roth contribution makes sense for your tax bracket. [calculator](http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/2qua49/roth_vs_traditional_calculator/cn9l3x2)
* Maximize contributions to tax advantaged accounts: 401k, IRA, HSA.
* Explore [Backdoor Roth IRA](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Backdoor_Roth_IRA) and "Mega backdoor Roth IRA".
* Choose low cost index funds.
* Charitable giving. Contributions to eligible organizations can be itemized as a deduction

## Education

* [529 plan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/529_plan)
* [Vanguard 529](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/whatweoffer/college/vanguard529)
  * $3,000 minimum
  * Age based options. I'm using the "moderate" option: starts at 75/25 stock/bond allocation

## Tools

* Monthly review of spending with [Mint](https://www.mint.com). Categorize
  spending, note any large differences in monthly trends. Link all accounts.
* Vanguard brokerage account. Using this for our Roth IRA and IRA.
* Setup direct deposit and auto-pay for all accounts.
* [FI planning tool](http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/2zhw7t/heres_an_fi_planning_tool_i_made_that_might_help/). My [version with cash worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_upAOikpuNxHSqPFlldY1s93OnjyrTr4oEVYEi3Of50/edit?usp=sharing).
