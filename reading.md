## Research papers

["Are Safe Withdrawal Rates Really Safe?"](http://financialmentor.com/retirement-planning/safe-withdrawal-rate/13192) gives an overview of safe withdrawal rates and references research on the topic. I don't trust it because it is poorly written and has a commercial agenda (affiliate links, newsletters, selling books). The following list is the primary research I'd like to follow up on to get to my own conclusions.

- Peter Lynch 1995: mortgage style amortization model
- Bengen 1994: Safemax in Journal of Financial Planning
- Cooley, Hubbard, and Walz (1998): Trinity study
- [Campbell and Shiller 1998](http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cd/d12b/d1295.pdf)
- [Wade Pfau 2010-2011](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1699526): safe withdrawal rate applied to international data
